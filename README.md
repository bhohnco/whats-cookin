Clicking on the heart icon will save a recipe to the user's favorites list and the cookpot will save
it to their recipes to cook list. Clicking on the silhouette user icon will triggers a purple drop down
that allows users to filter the scrolling feed to show the list of all recipes, their favorite list or
their list of recipes to cook.

The search icon at the top drops a search bar where visitors can search their favorite list, their
recipes to cook list or the entire database of recipes by name, ingredients or tags.
